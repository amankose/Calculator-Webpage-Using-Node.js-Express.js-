# Calculator-Webpage-Using-Node.js-Express.js-
While learning back-end programming. The first thing we need to learn is to create a server and make a small html page to take input, in back-end we use the data by node.js and express.js and calculate the input and give the correct calculated output. As it is my first experience on Node.js the webpage is very basic but it is very fun to do.
